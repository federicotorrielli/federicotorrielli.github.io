## Abstract

This paper explores how people experience the images created by generative artificial intelligence, examining their perceptions, appraisals, and emotions related to GenAI text-to-image models and their creations. Through empirical research, we investigate the cognitive and affective dimensions of human interaction with AI-generated visual content, revealing insights into how individuals make sense of and emotionally respond to images produced by generative AI systems.
