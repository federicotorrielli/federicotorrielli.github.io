Look, you've probably seen the papers and the courses, and yeah, that's a big part of what I do. But I'm not just sitting around thinking about language models all day (though, admittedly, more than I'd like to admit).

I read philosophy. A lot of it. Camus mostly. Something about the whole "life is absurd but we keep going anyway" thing resonates. Maybe it's the academic in me, or maybe it's just that his writing doesn't feel like work.

I play drums. Jazz when I want to get lost in it, math rock when I want my brain to hurt in a good way, alt rock when I just need to hit something loud. Started years ago and never really stopped. There's this thing that happens when you're in the middle of a groove that's hard to explain.

Gaming. Single-player RPGs specifically. The kind where you can sink 80 hours into and still find new things. I like the quiet of it, the way a good story can pull you in.

My house? Pretty much a 3D printing lab at this point. Started printing little useful things, then it escalated. Now if something breaks or I need something weird, I just make it. It's gotten out of hand but I'm not sorry about it.

I write poetry. Published a book in Italian, actually. It's different from the academic stuff. Looser, more about sound and feeling than proving a point. Sometimes you need that.

Oh, and I run two tabletop campaigns right now. D&D and Daggerheart. Being a GM is half storytelling, half improv comedy, half crisis management. Yes, that's three halves, that's how it feels. But when your players do something completely unexpected and you manage to roll with it? That's the good stuff.

So yeah. AI researcher by day, dice-rolling poetry-writing drummer by night. We contain multitudes or whatever.
